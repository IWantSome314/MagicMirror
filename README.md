# MagicMirror
Notes and description on making my magic mirror

List of needed items

1. Raspberry Pi (I used the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B version, due to the fact it has easy accessibility and an easy to set up wireless option)
2. Monitor 
3. Two Way Acrylic Glass Mirror (There are some online)
~~4. 4 x 3D Printed Brackets (These aren't necessary, however they make it easier to house the frame. Again, Hacker House has a website that supplies the STL and zip files for the design of the brackets - see link at bottom)~~
5. HDMI Cable
6. Micro HDMI Cable for Pi Power Supply
